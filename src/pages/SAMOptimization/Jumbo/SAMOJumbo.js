                A partner in our 600+ restaurant community found that servers
                spend around 14 minutes with guests. From these 14 minutes, only
                2 are spent entertaining your guests. The rest occupied with the
                boring, dreary stuff. CFO AIâ€™s hospitality tech takes care of
                the routine stuff by having each customer order directly from
                the kitchen.

                customer experience that keeps your seats filled.
