        CFO AI also trains your employees to be hospitality providers rather
        than just order takers. With a global hospitality ranking, they gain
        deeper insights into their ability to engage with customers and are
        provided with actionable steps to boost their ranking.
      </p>

      <p className="paragraph">
        This ‘gamifies’ the idea of providing hospitality to stir up some
        friendly competition amongst employees and maximize your customer
        retention.

        By combining the data points from both your POS and your food wastage,
        CFO AI calculates the performance of all menu items in real time and
        easily identifies the varying demands and profitabilities. Using these
        metrics, it indicates the menu changes that will result in the highest
        profit.
      </p>

      <p className="paragraph">
        For example, if two complementary items are performing well, then it may
        suggest a price increase or a combo to further incentivize purchase. On
        the other hand, if an item is performing poorly, the AI may suggest that
        you remove it.
      </p>

      <p className="paragraph">
        In other words, CFO AI optimizes your resources and sets your restaurant
        up for a prosperous future.
